\chapter{Attack scenarios}\label{chap:attack scenarios}

The goal of this \namecref{chap:attack scenarios} is to give an overview of various attacks on Peras, which either motivate a certain Peras rule/requirement or highlight what we can expect from sufficiently strong attacker within our margin of security.

\section{Attacks against Peras}

Here, we list attacks that a sufficiently strong adversary (within the margin of security) can execute and degrade the user experience this way (for example, due to reduced throughput or longer settlement times), but which do not threaten the core security properties of the system.

\subsection{Abstaining during voting}\label{sec:abstaining during voting}

An adversary with $\alpha$ stake will have $\alpha\cdot\perasN$ votes on average, so if they simply abstain, the honest nodes will likely fail to reach quorum even when they all vote for the same block when $\alpha \ge 1-\perasQuorum\perasN = 1/4$ for $\perasQuorum = 3/4 \cdot \perasN$.
Therefore, Peras doesn't provide fast settlement in the presence of an adversary with $\alpha\ge 25\%$, which is expected.

As usual, this is assuming full honest participation; smaller participation levels can only tolerate proportionally weaker adversaries.

Additionally, this attack (and others that are about preventing a quorum) gets more effective if the cryptographic scheme used for certificates requires votes of weight larger than \perasQuorum{} to certify a quorum, which is for example the case for ALBA due to its $n_p/n_f$ parameters \parencite{chaidos2024approximate}.

\subsection{Honest vote splitting}\label{sec:honest vote splitting}

In the pre-alpha version of Peras, honest nodes vote for the newest block on their selection that is at least \perasBlockMinSlots{} slots old.%
\footnote{There are potential variants of this rule (such as choosing the tip of the best chain made out of blocks that at least \perasBlockMinSlots{} slots old) that might mitigate the attack discussed here in certain scenarios, but they do not change the overall picture.}
It is relatively easy for an adversary to cause different honest nodes to vote for different blocks.

For example, this allows an adversary with $\alpha<0.25$ to prevent quorum formation with decent probability (which they couldn't do by simply abstaining) by splitting the honest votes such that neither block reaches quorum, causing the system to enter a cooldown period.
Future versions of Peras will improve on this front by adding a dedicated \emph{pre-agreement} mechanism that \emph{avoids} a cooldown in this scenario.

Write $\operatorname{tip}(C)$ for the tip of a chain $C$, and $\operatorname{trunc}(s,C)$ for the prefix of $C$ up until (but excluding) slot $s$.

Concretely, consider the voting phase at the beginning of round $r$ starting in slot $s$, with all honest nodes having selected chain $C_1$ just before.

Suppose that the adversary with stake $\alpha$ has a chain $C_2$ that is preferable to $C_1$, and $D_1 \neq D_2$ where \[D_i = \operatorname{tip}(\operatorname{trunc}(s-\perasBlockMinSlots,C_i))\] for $i\in\{1,2\}$.
If the adversary now diffuses $C_2$ to only a subset of the honest nodes right before $r$ starts (such that the remaining honest nodes only receive $C_2$ after $r$ began), these nodes will vote for $D_2$, while the rest will vote for $D_1$.

We can calculate a lower bound on the probability that an adversary has such a chain $C_2$ by considering a particular outcome of the leader schedule that guarantees the existence of $C_2$ when the adversary simply abstains while the honest chain is growing before round $r$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{enumi:honest vote splitting:a}
  There is at least one adversarial active slot in the interval $(h,s-\perasBlockMinSlots)$ where $h$ is the last honest active slot before $s-\perasBlockMinSlots$.
\item\label{enumi:honest vote splitting:b}
  There are not more honest than adversarial active slots in the interval $[s-\perasBlockMinSlots, s)$.
\end{enumerate}
Condition~\ref{enumi:honest vote splitting:a} guarantees that $D_1\neq D_2$, and condition~\ref{enumi:honest vote splitting:b} makes sure that $C_2$ is preferable to $C_1$.

We stress that this is not the only scenario where the attack can be executed; for example, we have not considered network delays, tiebreakers and honest short forks.
In general, the success rate of a vote splitting attack reduces to a (slot-based) settlement question. \Cite{gavzi2023practical} provides upper bounds for \emph{block-based} settlement; plausibly, the approach there can be adapted to yield upper bounds for the scenario here, too.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:honest vote splitting prob}
  For an adversary with stake $\alpha$ the probability that the events~\ref{enumi:honest vote splitting:a} and~\ref{enumi:honest vote splitting:b} occur before some Peras round is given by
  \[ P(H\le A) \cdot P(A' \ge 1) = P(H\le A) \cdot \left(1- \frac{\phi(1-\alpha)}{\asc}\right) \]
  where $H\sim\operatorname{Binom}(L,\phi(1-\alpha))$, $A\sim\operatorname{Binom}(L,\phi(\alpha))$, $A' \sim \operatorname{Binom}(H',\phi(\alpha))$, $H' \sim \operatorname{Geom}(\phi(1-\alpha))$\footnote{Here, we use the convention of counting the number of failures until the first success.}, and where $L= \perasBlockMinSlots$ and $\phi(\sigma) = 1-{(1-\asc)}^\sigma$ \parencite[(1)]{david2018ouroboros}.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Note that~\ref{enumi:honest vote splitting:a} and~\ref{enumi:honest vote splitting:b} are independent as they refer to disjoint sets of slots.

  The number of active slots out of $n$ total slots for a party with stake $\sigma$ is binomially distributed via $\operatorname{Binom}(n,\phi(\sigma))$, so $P(\enquote{\ref{enumi:honest vote splitting:a}}) = P(H\le A)$ is clear.

  The number of successive inactive slots until an active slot for a party with stake $\sigma$ is geometrically distributed via $\operatorname{Geom}(\phi(\sigma))$, so $H'$ counts the size of the interval $(h,s-L)$, and therefore $A' \sim \operatorname{Binom}(H',\phi(\alpha))$ counts the number of adversarial active slots in that interval.
  Thus, $P(\enquote{\ref{enumi:honest vote splitting:b}}) = P(A'\ge 1)$.

  Finally, we have
  \begin{align*}
    P(A' \ge 1) &= \sum_{k\ge 0} \underbrace{P(H' = k)}_{{(1-\phi(1-\alpha))}^k \phi(1-\alpha)} \cdot \underbrace{P(A' \ge 1 \mid H' = k)}_{1-{(1-\phi(\alpha))}^k} \\
                &= \phi(1-\alpha)\cdot \sum_{k\ge 0} {(1-\asc)}^{(1-\alpha)k} \left( 1- {(1-\asc)}^{\alpha k} \right) \\
                &= \phi(1-\alpha)\cdot\sum_{k\ge 0} {(1-\asc)}^{(1-\alpha)k} - {(1-\asc)}^k \\
                &= \phi(1-\alpha)\cdot \left(\sum_{k\ge 0} {\left({(1-\asc)}^{1-\alpha}\right)}^k - \sum_{k\ge 0} {(1-\asc)}^k \right) \\
                &= \phi(1-\alpha)\cdot \left( \frac1{\phi(1-\alpha)} - \frac1{\asc} \right) \\
                &= 1 - \frac{\phi(1-\alpha)}{\asc} \;.
  \end{align*}
  Note that $1-\phi(1-\alpha) / \asc \approx \alpha$.
\end{proof}

In \cref{lemma:honest vote splitting prob}, we assume that the gap $H'$, i.e.\ the length of the interval $(h,s-\perasBlockMinSlots)$, is sampled geometrically due to the leader schedule.
However, it can also be instructive to set it to a concrete value (letting $H'$ have a one-point distribution), especially if an adversary could force a long gap in some other way.

\end{figure}
We plot the probabilities of \cref{lemma:honest vote splitting prob} for realistic parameters in \cref{fig:honest vote splitting prob}.
We observe that for small values for \perasBlockMinSlots{}, even relatively weak adversaries can execute a vote splitting attack rather frequently.
This is relevant in particular as it allows them to trigger a cooldown phase.

\subsection{Density reduction via boost-induced rollbacks}\label{sec:density reduction via boost-induced rollbacks}

We now describe an adversarial strategy that results in the honest historical chain to have low density, but high weight, i.e.\ in the extreme case, there is one boosted block per Peras round, with every voting round being successful.
In that case, a simple (private) fork purely made out of adversarial blocks has a good chance to have higher density (but significantly lower weight) than the honest chain.

See \cref{sec:weighted genesis} for how this attack influences the Peras design.

Consider a Peras round $r$ starting in slot $s$.
During round $r$, the adversary (with stake $\alpha$) does not diffuse any votes or blocks until shortly before the end of round $r$ in slot $s+\perasRoundSlots$.
Let $C$ be the best chain that any honest node has selected in slot $s+\perasRoundSlots-1$.
The adversary arranges it such that during the voting phase of round $r$, no quorum is reached without the adversarial votes, and further, that honest votes with weight at most $\perasQuorum - \alpha$ are cast for a block $B$ that is \emph{not} on $C$.
The idea now is for the adversary to diffuse its $\alpha\cdot\perasN$ votes for $B$ near the end of round $r$ such that round $r$ is considered successful and $B$ receives a boost.
Then, under reasonable assumptions, the chain ending in $B$ is preferable to $C$ (as the latter doesn't contain a block that was boosted during round $r$), so the adversary succeeded in creating a low density but high weight chain during round $r$.

\medskip
Let us consider concretely how and under what conditions an attacker can execute this attack.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  To start the attack, the attacker needs to prevent a quorum out of honest votes during round $r$, and needs to ensure that votes of weight at least $\perasQuorum - \alpha$ are cast for a block that the honest nodes will not build upon during round $r$.

  One way to accomplish this is to execute an honest vote splitting attack, see \cref{sec:honest vote splitting}.

  If $\alpha<0.25$, then the adversary must proceed exactly as described there, in particular, diffuse an appropriate chain right before round $r$ starts, in order to prevent a quorum purely made out of honest votes.
  On the other hand, if $\alpha\ge 0.25$, preventing an honest quorum is trivial, see \cref{sec:abstaining during voting}, so the adversary also has the option to diffuse the better chain even after $r$ started.
\item
  The round length \perasRoundSlots{} must not be too long in relation to \perasBoost{}, i.e.
  \[ \perasBoost \ge \phi(1-\alpha)\cdot \perasRoundSlots \;. \]
  Otherwise, the honest chain built during round $r$ might have more weight than the block $B$ (plus additional adversarial blocks on top of $B$) despite not having a boost.
  The attacker can still execute a less effective version of the attack by diffusing their votes significantly \emph{before} the end of round $r$.

  However, for realistic/useful Cardano mainnet parameters, such as $\perasRoundSlots = 90$ and $\perasBoost = 15$, this is not a problem for the adversary.
\item
  Once an adversary successfully performed the attack in a round, they can repeat it with good probability like this.
  The idea is for the adversary to mint two blocks $B_1,B_2$ on top of $B$ between slot $s-\perasBlockMinSlots$ and $s+\perasRoundSlots -\perasBlockMinSlots$, where $B_1$ is preferable to $B_2$.
  Then, they execute an honest vote splitting attack between $B_1$ and $B_2$ for round $r+1$, such that neither block reaches quorum just due to honest votes, but such that $B_2$ votes having weight $\perasQuorum - \alpha$ at least.
  This is exactly the necessary setup to continue with the attack.

  The number of elections of a party with stake $\sigma$ within $n$ slots is given by
  \[ E_{n,\sigma}\sim\operatorname{Pois}(-n\sigma\log(1-\asc)) \]
  in the limiting case when the stake is distributed across infinitely many stake pools.
  Therefore, the probability that the adversary gets two elections in the aforementioned slot interval of size \perasRoundSlots{} is bounded by $P(E_{\perasRoundSlots,\alpha}\ge 2)$.
  For example, for $\perasRoundSlots = 90$ and $\alpha=0.4$, this evaluates to $55.09\%$.

  The number of successive successful rounds is hence geometrically distributed.
  Note that all blocks added to the chain in the meantime are adversarial, hence impacting chain quality.\footnote{However, such reductions in chain quality are not necessarily too unexpected in the presence of such strong adversaries, and the situation might overall still be better than with pure Praos.}
\end{enumerate}

These probabilities seem sufficiently large to us to take this attack seriously.
A more detailed analysis (potentially simulating the resulting Markov chain) is out-of-scope for this document.

\subsection{Compromised voting keys}

Suppose that an honest stake pool is compromised, exposing its private keys to an adversary.
On a high level, the security analysis of the protocol simply considers such a pool to be adversarial.

Note that, due to the use of forward-secure cryptography via key-evolving signatures \parencite{bellare1999forward} (also see \cref{sec:cert reqs}), and assuming an otherwise good operational record, the adversary can only act on the compromised pool's behalf by signing new blocks or voting from the time of the attack onward (modulo the granularity of key evolution), but \emph{not} before.

However, as raised in \cite[Section 2.2.4]{kant2020shelley}, it is still desirable to allow an honest pool operator to revoke the compromised keys and mitigate the adversarial impact as much as possible, without requiring any action from delegators.

The approach used by Cardano today relies on the pool operator maintaining a \emph{cold key} on a separate machine that is assumed to remain secure even if the stake pool is compromised.
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Regarding the hot block signing key, the pool operator can immediately create a new operational certificate using the cold key with an incremented \emph{issue number}, which takes precedence over the compromised key in a specific sense affecting both the tiebreaker in the chain order as well as header validity; see \cite[Section 3.3.7 and 3.3.8]{kant2020shelley}.
\item
  Regarding the VRF signing key, the adversary gains knowledge of the leader schedule of the compromised pool until the operator registers a new VRF signing key on-chain (which requires the cold key).
\end{itemize}

Regarding the Peras voting key, as with the VRF signing key, the adversary can vote just like the honest operator until a new key has been registered on-chain.
With the current Ledger rules \parencite[Section 9.4 \enquote{Stake Pool Rules}]{shelley-ledger-specs}, this takes between two and three epochs (depending on when the transaction with the stake pool registration certificate gets included on-chain), which corresponds to \numrange{10}{15} days.
We briefly mention two possibilities of reducing this period.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  The reason for \emph{one} epoch in this delay is to allow delegators to respond to changes in pool parameters such as pool cost.
  This motivation does not apply to the scenario of this section (in fact, the same can be said for the VRF key), so it could simply be skipped in this case to reduce the delay to \numrange{5}{10} days.
\item
  Instead of storing the public key for Peras voting in the pool parameters which only change on epoch boundaries, the Ledger could maintain Peras-specific fine-grained snapshots tracking the set of Peras voting keys for every Peras round.
  Then, to verify votes in a Peras round, the keys from the latest snapshot which is at least one stability version old (compared to the onset of the round) are used.
  At the cost of additional Ledger complexity, the delay could therefore be reduced to a stability window (\qty{36} hours),
\end{enumerate}

During this period, however, the actual impact of these adversarial votes is limited:
Honest nodes will still only download at most one (potentially equivocating) vote per election seat, cf.~\cref{sec:attack equivocations}, so there is no increased bandwidth usage.
However, this rule can prevent an honest node from seeing a quorum purely based on votes in case it first receives an equivocating adversarial vote for a useless block.
But as long as at least one honest node observes a quorum, it will diffuse the resulting certificate instead, ensuring the success of the round.

Using operational certificates for Peras voting could further improve the mitigation of key exposure (namely by making sure that a vote with a higher issue number definitely propagates to all honest peers).
However, this would greatly inflate the size of votes and especially certificates (due to the lack of efficient aggregation) without significantly more complicated cryptography, cf.~\cref{chap:req cands certs}.

\section{Attacks motivating aspects of the Peras design}

Here, we list attacks that motivate (and are hence prevented by) certain rules of the Peras design.

\subsection{Attacks motivating cooldown periods and their structure}\label{sec:attack cooldowns}

\subsubsection{\enquote{Certificate-up-the-sleeve} attacks}

Fundamentally, the concept of cooldown periods, i.e.\ honest nodes stopping to vote when a round failed to reach quorum before the next round, is required to defend against the adversary having a certificate \enquote{up their sleeve} by releasing their votes late.

Concretely, an adversary can be in a position where they are in possession of votes of sufficient weight to complete a quorum for a given round, but they can do so at any time they wish by releasing the votes \emph{late}.
This is trivial for an adversary with at least $1-\perasQuorum = \qty{25}{\percent}$ of the stake by abstaining, cf.~\cref{sec:abstaining during voting}, but even possible for weaker adversaries via vote splitting attacks, cf.~\cref{sec:honest vote splitting}.

If honest nodes do not stop voting when a round failed to reach quorum, then adversaries can execute a \emph{balancing attack} by growing two forks with equal weight, violating safety in the form of the common prefix property.
In the ideal case, one fork is relatively dense (say $(k+1) \cdot \perasBoost$ blocks), but does not contain any boosted blocks, while the other contains few blocks, but every block is boosted (say $k$ blocks, such that the total weight is also $(k+1)\cdot\perasBoost$).

\medskip
In the actual Peras protocol, this is prevented by stopping to vote when a round did not give rise to a quorum before the next round, and then waiting sufficiently long (\Theal{} slots) until the advantage gained by an adversary possibly having a certificate up their sleeve has been neutralized by running normal Praos.

Note that the node can also restart earlier, say in some round $r$, if they observe a certificate for round $r-1$ before round $r$ starts.
This is because sufficiently many honest nodes (having stake at least $\perasQuorum - \alpha > \qty{25}{\percent}$ where $\alpha<1/2$ is the adversarial stake) must have voted in round $r-1$ and hence the node just did not observe the certificate for round $r-2$ in time in contrast to these other nodes.
Also see \cref{sec:attack block creation rule}.

\subsubsection{Attacks on the honest voting restart rule}

Naturally, we need a rule for honest nodes to \emph{restart} voting after waiting for at least \Theal{} slots.
Note that whatever rule we choose, an adversary with at least $1-\perasQuorum = \qty{25}{\percent}$ stake can immediately cause us to fail to reach quorum again.
However, we want to prevent adversaries with less stake from causing different honest to restart voting in different rounds, as this allows them to cause us to immediately re-enter a cooldown, akin to vote splitting attacks, cf.~\cref{sec:honest vote splitting}.
It still might be acceptable if weak adversaries can achieve this with sufficiently small probability, but it introduces yet another failure mode where Peras is ineffective temporarily.

For example, the simple rule
\begin{tcolorbox}
  Restart voting \perasCooldownRounds{} rounds (or an integral multiple of that) after the round $r$ of the most recent observed certificate.
\end{tcolorbox}
\parindent0pt
does not satisfy this property:
An attacker controlling stake $\alpha$ with a certificate up their sleeve for round $r+1$ can release this certificate just before round $r+\perasCooldownRounds$ such that honest nodes with stake of at least $\perasQuorum - \alpha$ do not observe it when they decide to vote in that round, while the remaining honest nodes do.
Therefore, some honest nodes restart voting in round $r+\perasCooldownRounds$, while the rest does so in round $r+\perasCooldownRounds+1$.
The adversary now has a certificate up their sleeve for round $r+\perasCooldownRounds+1$, and can continue this attack as they wish, forcing an eternal cooldown.

The actual Peras voting rules sidestep these problems with heavy machinery by relying on Praos as a consensus protocol, letting nodes include their most recent certificate on chain (also see \cref{sec:attack block creation rule}) during a cooldown period.
Concretely, we have the following rules when deciding whether to restart voting in round $r$:
\begin{description}
\item[(VR-2A)] The latest observed certificate is at least \perasIgnoranceRounds{} old.

  Here, (VR-2A) makes sure that a certificate indicating the start of this cooldown period has been included on-chain (this depends on whether/when the adversary decided to release the certificate up their sleeve).
  Therefore, \perasIgnoranceRounds{} encompasses a chain quality window \Tcq{} in addition to \Theal{}.
\item[(VR-2B)] The latest certificate in the current chain is from a round exactly $c\cdot \perasCooldownRounds$ ago for $c \in\mathbb{N}_{>0}$.

  This makes sure that we restart at least \perasCooldownRounds{} (or a multiple of that if no quorum was reached on a previous restart) after the last unsuccessful round.
  On top of \Theal{} and \Tcq{}, \perasCooldownRounds{} contains a chain growth window \Tcp{} guaranteeing common prefix, such that all honest nodes agree when to restart.
\end{description}

As noted above, it is acceptable to parameterize \Tcq{} and \Tcp{} in this context for an attacker with at most $1-\perasQuorum{} = \qty{25}{\percent}$ stake, allowing to reduce the length of cooldown periods at least somewhat.

\subsection{Attack on a variant of the block creation rule}\label{sec:attack block creation rule}

Peras enters a \emph{cooldown period} when a round does not give rise to a certificate.
In order to coordinate the \emph{end} of the cooldown period, a certificate is included on chain.

When an honest node is elected in a slot in round $r$, it includes the latest certificate $\cert'$ it has seen if and only if all of the following hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{rule:block creation:a} The node has not seen a certificate $\cert$ with $\round(\cert)=r-2$.
\item\label{rule:block creation:b} $r-\round(\cert') \le \perasCertMaxRounds$.
\item\label{rule:block creation:c} $\round(\cert') > \round(\cert^*)$.
\end{enumerate}
Here, rule~\ref{rule:block creation:c} makes sure that an honest node never includes a certificate that has already been included in our current selection.
Rule~\ref{rule:block creation:b} allows us to disregard votes/certificates beyond a certain age.

Rule~\ref{rule:block creation:a} makes sure that all honest nodes have stopped voting, preventing useless certificate inclusions.
Concretely, rule~\ref{rule:block creation:a} implies that no honest node voted in round $r-1$, assuming that round $r-3$ was successful (i.e.\ we were not in a cooldown phase, so the voting rule (VR-2A) doesn't apply in round $r-1$).

To see this, we consider the contrapositive, i.e.\ assume that an honest node \emph{did} vote during round $r-1$.
Due to voting rule (VR-1A), it must have observed a certificate for round $r-2$ at the beginning of round $r-1$.
However, as $\perasRoundSlots\ge\perasDelta$, the votes for that certificate (including adversarial ones) must have been diffused to all honest nodes before round $r$.
Therefore, rule~\ref{rule:block creation:a} is not satisfied for any honest node during round $r$.\qed{}

In contrast, if we were to modify rule~\ref{rule:block creation:a} to be about the absence of a certificate in round $r-1$, then an adversary could force nodes to unnecessarily include a certificate on chain.
Concretely, the adversary can diffuse its votes shortly before the start of round $r$, such that some honest nodes see a quorum for round $r-1$, while others do not.
If the latter category of nodes is sufficiently small, then them not voting during round $r$ does not preclude the possibility of round $r$ being successful, in which case they will vote again in round $r + 1$ as normal.
However, the modified rule~\ref{rule:block creation:a} would still force them to include the most recent certificate on chain when they are elected before they receive the adversarial votes for round $r-1$, which we want to avoid.

It may be useful to clarify that the harm of honest nodes unnecessarily including a certificate on chain is not necessarily the presence of the certificate itself.
Note that an adversary can include a certificate in any block they mint, for example, with the only risk being reputational harm.
Instead, the harm done by honest nodes including unnecessary certificates in the honest blocks they mint is that the limit on block size means the bytes occupied by the certificate could have otherwise been occupied by transactions.

\subsection{Adding weight to Genesis density comparisons}\label{sec:weighted genesis}

The implementation approach of Ouroboros Genesis in the Cardano node fundamentally relies on the following property, justified by the analysis of the Genesis chain selection rule in~\cite{badertscher2018ouroboros}:
\begin{tcolorbox}[title=\densityOfCompetingChainsName]\label{property:density-of-competing-chains}
  Let $p$ be any historical point on the honest chain. The honest chain of a net that has always executed Praos under nominal conditions will have strictly higher density in the \sgen{} slots immediately following $p$ than any alternative chain that intersects at $p$.
\end{tcolorbox}
Here, the \emph{density} of a chain in a range of slots is defined to be the number of blocks in that range.

\medskip
With Peras, it is natural to modify this property to talk about the \emph{weight} in the \sgen{} slots instead of just the number of blocks:
\begin{tcolorbox}[title=\weightedDensityOfCompetingChainsName]\label{property:weighted-density-of-competing-chains}
  Let $p$ be any historical point on the honest chain. The honest chain of a net that has always executed Peras under nominal conditions will have strictly higher weight in the \sgen{} slots immediately following $p$ than any alternative chain that intersects at $p$.
\end{tcolorbox}
In the implementation, relying on this rule instead of \densityOfCompetingChains{} results in additional complexity and operational costs:
\begin{itemize}
\item A syncing node must download certificates in order to perform Genesis density comparisons.
  This requires modifications to the existing Genesis logic, which currently gets by with looking purely at header chains.
\item Nodes need to store certificates boosting blocks on the historical/immutable chain stored indefinitely, such that they can be given to syncing peers.
  This increases disk and outbound bandwidth requirements.
\end{itemize}
However, this complexity is necessary, as \cref{sec:density reduction via boost-induced rollbacks} describes an attack that would be possible if we were to keep using \densityOfCompetingChains{} instead of implementing \weightedDensityOfCompetingChains{}.
Concretely, the adversary can use the attack to let the honest chain have less than $\phi(\alpha) \cdot \sgen$ blocks (i.e.\ the average number of blocks on a chain they can create completely by themselves) in a window of $\sgen$ slots, despite having higher weight.
Once successful, the adversary can cause syncing nodes to commit to the adversarial chain permanently, violating safety.

\subsection{Spamming equivocating votes}\label{sec:attack equivocations}

The adversary can equivocate any of their seats in the voting committee of a Peras round by creating more than one vote for each seat, voting for different blocks.
An adversary with $\alpha<1/2$ stake can not use this to cause a quorum for different blocks in the same round due to the choice of $\perasQuorum = 3/4$ and a quorum intersection argument.

However, in a naive implementation, the adversary can use equivocating votes to cause unbounded additional network traffic for honest nodes.
Most directly, they can send many equivocating votes to any of their peers individually.
If this is disallowed (by requiring nodes to only forward the first vote per voting committee seat per round), the adversary can diffuse different equivocating votes to different peers, such that nodes still download many different equivocating votes from their peers.

We now describe how this can be avoided; specifically, honest nodes will only ever download at most one vote (or alternatively, a bounded amount of votes) per voting committee seat per round.

An honest node downloads votes from its peers in two stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{enumi:equivocation:step 1}
  In the first stage, it requests and downloads \emph{vote IDs} from its peers.

  The vote ID must be chosen as to uniquely identify a voting committee seat in a particular round.
  Concretely, it can be represented as the round number and a proof of eligibility, which might be the stake pool identity or a VRF proof.

  Also, we assume vote IDs to be significantly smaller than full votes.
\item\label{enumi:equivocation:step 2}
  In the second stage, the node downloads votes corresponding to all vote IDs \emph{without duplicates}.
  Upon receiving a vote, it is checked that the vote matches the supplied vote ID.\@

  This way, observing equivocating votes is impossible.
\end{enumerate}
As an optimization (for example to reduce the impact of slow peers), the same vote ID could also be requested from multiple peers (bounded by a small constant) in~\ref{enumi:equivocation:step 2}.
While possible and sound, it is not necessary to discard equivocating votes received this way.

Additionally, this approach requires us to diffuse of certificates in addition to votes in general (even between caught-up peers).
To see why, consider two honest nodes $H_1,H_2$ and an adversarial node $A$ which are pairwise connected.
Suppose that we are in round $r$, both $H_1$ and $H_2$ are only one vote short of a quorum for the block $B$ in round $r$, and all honest votes for round $r$ have already been diffused.
Now the adversary sends $H_1$ and $H_2$ a new vote ID $\mi{vid}$, and then equivocates $\mi{vid}$ to send a vote $v_B$ for $B$ to $A$, but a vote $v_{B'}$ for a block $B' \neq B$ to $A'$.
Now $A$ observes a quorum for $B$ in round $r$, creating a certificate, while $A'$ does not.
The vote diffusion mechanism described above causes $A'$ to not request a vote for $\mi{vid}$ from $A$, because $A'$ already has received $v_{B'}$.\footnote{Potentially, if $A'$ implements the optimization mentioned above, i.e.\ to download votes for the same vote id from multiple peers opportunistically, they might download $v_B$ from $A$, but this is not something we can rely on in general.}
Overall, the honest nodes $A$ and $A'$ now disagree whether round $r$ was successful, which they would not have if they had exchanged all equivocating votes.

However, by letting nodes also exchange \emph{certificates} in addition to votes (in a separate protocol, see \cref{sec:certificate-diffusion}), this scenario can be avoided.
Concretely, $A'$ would ask $A$ for a certificate for round $r$, and then download the certificate for $B$.
It does not matter that the certificate was built using an equivocating vote; in general, depending on the cryptographic scheme used for building certificates, it can even be impossible to detect this.
By construction, there can be at most one certificate per round, so there is no risk of equivocating certificates.
