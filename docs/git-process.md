# Peras-specific Git process

This is a short description of the Git/GitHub workflow for Peras-related changes, extending the upstream [Consensus Git Processes](https://ouroboros-consensus.cardano.intersectmbo.org/docs/howtos/contributing/consensus_git_process)

## Branches

The development of Peras will largely take place in [`ouroboros-consensus`](github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-consensus), but will also touch other repositories like [`ouroboros-network`](github.com/IntersectMBO/ouroboros-network), [`cardano-ledger`](github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-ledger) and [`cardano-node`](github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node).

The goal is to merge all changes into the respective repositories *before* Peras is complete (potentially gated behind feature flags, cf. [tweag/cardano-peras#96](https://github.com/tweag/cardano-peras/issues/96)). However, in order to decouple the Peras development from the timeliness of reviews by the maintainers of the respective repository, we will first merge our changes into `peras-staging` branches after review by the Peras team. These branches are based on top of a recent commit on the main branch or a release branch, depending on our needs.

From time to time, changes from `peras-staging` are taken, polished and submitted for inclusion into the main branch of the repository. This way, the amount of changes in `peras-staging` branches to be rebased stays relatively small.

Note that `peras-staging` branches might need (at least temporarily) to depend on `peras-staging` branches from other repositories via [`source-repository-package`s](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cabal-project-description-file.html#taking-a-dependency-from-a-source-code-repository). This requires coordination when rebasing `peras-staging` branches.

## Pull Requests targeting `peras-staging`

Pull requests against `peras-staging` branches must

 - be opened as draft, to indicate that they are not meant to be reviewed by the maintainers of the given repo, and
 - labelled to indicate that they are Peras-specific (if such a label exists).

The PR title may additionally include a `[WIP]` to indicate to the Peras team that it is still work-in-progress (as the draft status cannot be used to signal that).

### Merging

Once a PR has been reviewed and is ready, it can be merged through the GitHub UI after marking it as `Ready to review`. However, this may notify repository maintainers about changes that i) were not meant for them to review, and ii) are already merged by the time they check.

To avoid this, we usually merge PRs by pushing directly into `peras-staging`:

```bash
git checkout peras-staging
git merge --ff-only peras/your-fancy-new-feature
git push origin peras-staging
```

GitHub will recognize that the PRâ€™s commits are included in the target branch and automatically close it. Note, however, that this bypasses the configured [merge queue](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue). Using `--ff-only` ensures the merge does not introduce conflicts and helps prevent `peras-staging` from ending up in a broken state.
